# Summer Camp Song List

This page is an addendum to the Camp Barton Songbook, by Jeff Andrews.  The
songbook only contains lyrics and some hints about the tunes.  Often, the way
we sing the songs can be a little bit different from the sheet music you might
find elsewhere on the internet.  This site attempts to capture the "Camp Barton
way" that these songs are performed.

If you think you found a mistake, please let me know
[over on github](https://github.com/pbaughman/songbook) which is also where
you'll find the raw data this sheet music is generated from.
